# Development Guidelines

## Critical Requirement: Careful, Thorough, and Precise Work

- **Always approach code changes and debugging with maximum attention to detail.**
- **Do not make assumptions.** Every step must be justified by evidence from the codebase, documentation, or direct observation.
- **Be methodical and step-by-step.** Analyze the root cause, confirm types and signatures, and double-check all logic before making changes.
- **Document reasoning and decisions.** If a fix is made, explain why it is correct and how it addresses the specific error or requirement.
- **Prioritize clarity and maintainability.**
- **If in doubt, investigate further before acting.**

This requirement is mandatory for all contributors and applies to all code, documentation, and review activities.

# Development Guidelines for Doggy DayCare App

## Critical Principles (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

### 1. NEVER MAKE ASSUMPTIONS
- Always examine the actual code implementation before making changes
- Verify the current behavior by reading the relevant files
- Don't assume how something works - check the code

### 2. ALWAYS VERIFY BEFORE CHANGING
- Read the actual implementation in the files
- Understand what the code currently does
- Test your understanding before proposing changes

### 3. BE THOROUGH IN ANALYSIS
- Don't rush to solutions
- Examine all related files and dependencies
- Consider the full impact of changes
- Check for edge cases and potential issues

### 4. ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
- If something is unclear, ask for clarification
- Don't guess what the user wants
- Confirm requirements before implementing
- Better to ask than to make wrong assumptions

## Business Critical App Rules
- This is a business app that people rely on
- Every change must be carefully considered
- Test changes thoroughly before committing
- Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change it
- Document any significant changes

## Code Quality Standards
- Write clear, readable code
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Ensure error handling is robust
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## When Making Changes
1. First understand the current implementation
2. Identify the specific problem or requirement
3. Propose a solution that addresses the exact need
4. Test the solution thoroughly
5. Document any changes made

## Remember
- This app manages real business data
- Users depend on it working correctly
- Accuracy is more important than speed
- When in doubt, ask for clarification
